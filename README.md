My name is Felipe Mello and I am an Acoustical Engineering student and researcher from Brazil. 

Here is where I upload some of my codes and projects, mainly functions that I use every now and then (check out my [acoustics_dsp_toolbox](https://github.com/felipe-mello/acoustics_dsp_toolbox) repo).

I am currently studying solutions for cost-effective high quality acoustical measurements on embedded systems based on digital MEMS microphones. You can check out some of my published work below:
